> Tool for finding logs using certain talents and/or items

Whenever you are developing modules for the great [WowAnalyzer](https://wowanalyzer.com/),
you often find yourself looking for a log of a player using a niche talent or item so that
you can verify if your code is detecting the events as appropriate.

To help myself with this, I wrote this tool that fetches logs from Warcraftlogs, and allows
filtering by talents and items.

The code is not great, it was put together as a utility rather than as a service.
